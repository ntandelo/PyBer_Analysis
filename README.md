# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project
We must complete additional analysis on data set including the following deliverables:
* Summary dataframe of ride-sharing data by city type
* Graph showing total weekly fares for each city type

### Purpose
To analyze ride-sharing data across three different types of cities. 

## Results Summary

### Analysis 
Ride sharing is more popular in densely populated areas. The number of drivers per area reflects this.

However, the amount paid to the drivers is not a straight correlation between density of population and price. 
As shown below, average fares were highest in rural areas, likely due to longer distances needed to travel.

However, since the need for rides is higher in urban areas, even compensating for the higher fare per driver, urgan drivers tend to make the most money.

## Recommendations
The following recommendations for business are as follows:
* Look in to daily rides to see if certain days are more popular in rural, urban, or suburban areas
* Analyze based on weather - in January there is a slight increase in rural rides, this may be due to cold weather
* Look in to increasing fares in rural areas
